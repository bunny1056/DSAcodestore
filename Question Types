Greedy Algorithms:

Use when the problem can be broken down into a series of steps where a locally optimal choice leads to a globally optimal solution.

Examples: Activity selection, Huffman coding, Kruskal's algorithm for MST.

Sorting:

Use when the order of processing elements affects the solution.

Examples: Interval scheduling, meeting rooms, finding pairs with a certain property.

Array Manipulation:

Use when the solution requires dynamic insertion, deletion, or reordering of elements in an array.

Examples: Inserting intervals, merging overlapping intervals.

Rearranging/Scheduling:

Use when the problem involves arranging elements based on certain precedence or constraints.

Examples: Task scheduling, queue reconstruction by height.
